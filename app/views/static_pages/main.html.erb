<h1>Philosophy</h1>
<p>Dr. Ziecheck believes that medicine combines both science and art to achieve optimum results. Her practice takes a holistic, creative approach towards the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Using evidence-based medicine, in combination with an individualized treatment plan, Dr. Ziecheck and her patients embark together on a program to optimize good health and well-being.</p>
<p>Part of this process involves taking the necessary time to listen, examine, investigate and consult with others to design a plan tailored specifically for each patient’s needs. Dr. Ziecheck’s philosophy is to try to keep her patients out of the Emergency Room or hospital, unless of course, that is the appropriate place for those very ill patients. Park 55 Medical Associates maintains its own on-site laboratory, which makes obtaining critical lab results available in minutes, rather than hours or days. This gives Dr. Ziecheck immediate access to information in making treatment decisions, which either saves the patient a potentially unnecessary trip to the Hospital or expedites emergency treatment. In either case, fast and appropriate treatment is achieved.</p>
